These are various scripts relating to ameuter radio.


morse.py
--------


A Python script which encodes an ASCII message with
[International Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Morse_Code#Letters.2C_numbers.2C_punctuation)
and plays the message with a system beep.

The beeps are played with Johnathan Nightingale's
[beep](http://www.johnath.com/beep/). This program must be downloaded and
compiled by the user.

This script could be used in conjuction with John Walker's
[codegroup](http://www.fourmilab.ch/codegroup/), which converts any binary data
into five-letter code groups, thereby bypassing internet censorship.
